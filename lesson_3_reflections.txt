When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  When you're working form multiple computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  It could over write the changes you made on your computer.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

  Forks copy another github repository into your github repository. Clone copies
  a repository onto your computer. Branches and splits off the repository you
  are working on. Forks can be used when you're copying someones public
  repository. Clones for copying a repository to your computer. Branches for
  trying out new features or fixing bugs in your repository.
