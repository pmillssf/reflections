When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  When you're working form multiple computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  It could over write the changes you made on your computer.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

  Forks copy another github repository into your github repository. Clone copies
  a repository onto your computer. Branches and splits off the repository you
  are working on. Forks can be used when you're copying someones public
  repository. Clones for copying a repository to your computer. Branches for
  trying out new features or fixing bugs in your repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

  It allows you to compare changes you've made when you're offline

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

  Sharing files over dropbox or a similar system. It would be harder to keep
  track of changes made by other collaborators, but simpler to share the file
  since it would just be dragging it into the dropbox folder. Obviously, not
  an advantage that's worth it.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master?
What benefits does each approach have?

  When collaborating with others it can make sense to make changes in a separate
  branch to make communicating your changes easier and ensuring your collaborators
  agree. Making changes directly in master are faster since you don't need to
  merge the branch, but ultimately can make things messy.
